# edemy-client 

HEY GUYS. 

Welcome to my Fourth year project. 
I am building an E-Learning platform. I have always wanted to work on something to improve the education system in my country because I have always felt that its is lacking in some ways.
Due to recent events namely the pandemic that caused a halt in physical studies, I felt that this would be the right project. I am learning from currently deployed e-learning platforms to see what works and I am going to try to improve and add functionalities so that my system works for institutions in my country. One of these functionalities is implenting payment systems that are most convenient in Kenya.

This is the server-side. Frontend in different repo named edemy-server. 
#NOTE. Name not decided yet. Repo name is not the actual name of the platform.

DEVELOPMENT. 

I decided am not going to overengineer this project because not everything has to be complicated and because I pride myself in simple and functional code.

So one language. Javascript.

For the front-end i am going to use figma for the design because it is. you guessed it. FREE, and also I found it very easy to use even without my design background. 

FOR THE ACTUAL CODE.

I am going to use React JS,  JavaScript component framework by Facebook because I really love it awesome. I also find that how react does things by using components and building all your things in these components that you can export and import very convenient. 

TWIST.
 
I am not going to use pure react because doing some things in react sometimes can be very hectic and because NextJs does things better. I love the file system in NextJs. If you have multiple pages you just put the files in the pages folder and NextJs will automatically do the routing for you. 

FOR THE STYLING. 

We are going to use bootstrap.  I've been learning tailwind CSS for this project however I am not going to use it. But for all the projects after this I will be using tailwind CSS. If you want to see some of that make sure to check out the projects that I'm going to be doing after this. 

FOR THIS BACKEND.

I am going to be using node JS. Ever since I picked up new JS it has been my go-to for all my backends. For the middle where I'm going to use ExpressJs. Again since I came across Express it has been my go-to middleware for all my projects. I find that these two work really well together. 

FOR THE CLOUD

I am going to use AWS. AWS S3 for the storage because this project is going to be using a lot of cloud storage because we have to store the courses in video form that these tractors are going to make. I am a student with no employment and no cash but luckily AWS has a free tier so I am going to be making use of that.
